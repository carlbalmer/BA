%\section{Welcome and Thank You}
The main focus of this thesis is indoor localization of mobile devices.

With today's ubiquity of mobile computing, it has become evermore important for these devices to be aware of their location. Location awareness is fundamental for many possible applications such as pedestrian navigation and location based marketing in large building complexes (e.g. universities, airports, hospitals) or audio-guides for museums.

In contrast to outdoor localization, where we have GPS and other established solutions, indoor localization still remains challenging. Some of the reasons for this include the inability of the GPS signal to penetrate into the building and the effects of non-line-of-sight and multipath propagation on radio waves deteriorating the signal to be less accurate for localization\cite{JoseMaster,multipathEffects}. In addition to these challenges indoor location based applications usually require higher accuracy than those outdoors; An error of four meters is acceptable for street navigation but not for a museum guide.
