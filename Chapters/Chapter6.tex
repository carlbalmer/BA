\section{Summary and Conclusion}


Indoor localization remains a challenging problem in computer science.

In this thesis I propose and develop a room recognition system based on WiFi signals and the magnetic field. I suggest to add this system to a the existing localization approach and use the information it provides to determine better weights for the trilateration and therefore improve the localization.

I carry out two experiments to optimize the room recognition and to determine the best performing weighting model.

Finally I implement my new approach in a large test bed and evaluate its performance.

Concerning the room recognition I conclude that it is...
