abstract={Indoor positioning has become an emerging research area because of huge commercial demands for location-based services in indoor environments. Channel State Information (CSI) as a fine-grained physical layer information has been recently proposed to achieve high positioning accuracy by using range-based methods, e.g., trilateration. In this work, we propose to fuse the CSI-based ranges and velocity estimated from inertial sensors by an enhanced particle filter to achieve highly accurate tracking. The algorithm relies on some enhanced ranging methods and further mitigates the remaining ranging errors by a weighting technique. Additionally, we provide an efficient method to estimate the velocity based on inertial sensors. The algorithms are designed in a network-based system, which uses rather cheap commercial devices as anchor nodes. We evaluate our system in a complex environment along three different moving paths. Our proposed tracking method can achieve 1.3m for mean accuracy and 2.2m for 90% accuracy, which is more accurate and stable than pedestrian dead reckoning and range-based positioning.},

abstract={The use of magnetic field variations for positioning and navigation has been suggested by several researchers. In most of the applications, the magnetic field is used to determine the azimuth or heading. However, for indoor applications, accurate heading determination is difficult due to the presence of magnetic field anomalies. Here location fingerprinting methodology can take advantage of these anomalies. In fact, the more significant the local anomalies, the more unique the magnetic “fingerprint”. In general, the more elements in each fingerprint, the better for positioning. Unfortunately, magnetic field intensity data only consists of three components. Since true north (or magnetic north) is generally unknown, even with help of the accelerometer to detect the direction of the gravity, only two components can be extracted, i.e. the horizontal intensity and the vertical intensity (or total intensity and inclination). Furthermore, moving objects containing ferromagnetic materials and electronic devices may affect the magnetic field. Tests were carried out to investigate the feasibility of using magnetic field alone for indoor positioning. Possible solutions are discussed.},

abstract={To improve our understanding of the indoor properties of the perturbed Earth's magnetic field, we have developed a methodology to obtain dense and spatially referenced samples of the magnetic vector field on the ground's surface and in the free space above. This methodology draws on the use of various tracking techniques (photometric, odometric, and motion capture) to accurately determine the pose of the magnetic sensor, which can be positioned manually by humans or autonomously by robots to acquire densely gridded sample datasets. We show that the indoor magnetic field exhibits a fine-grained and persistent micro-structure of perturbations in terms of its direction and intensity. Instead of being a hindrance to indoor navigation, we believe that the variations of the three vector components are sufficiently expressive to form re-recognizable features based on which accurate localization is possible. We provide experimental results using our methodology to map the magnetic field on the ground's surface in our indoor research facilities. With the use of a magnetometer and very little computation, these resulting maps can serve to compensate the perturbations and subsequently determine pose of a human or robot in dead reckoning applications.},

abstract={Received signal strength based fingerprinting approaches have been widely exploited for localization. The received signal strength (RSS) plays a very crucial role in determining the nature and characteristics of location fingerprints stored in a radio-map. The received signal strength is a function of distance between the transmitter and receiving device, which varies due to various in-path interferences. A detailed analysis of factors affecting the received signal for indoor localization is presented in this paper. The paper discusses the effect of factors such as spatial, temporal, environmental, hardware and human presence on the received signal strength through extensive measurements in a typical IEEE 802.11b/g/n network. It also presents the statistical analysis of the measured data that defines the reliability of RSS-based location fingerprints for indoor localization.},
